\*:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧ *Hi, I'm Lucy* .⋆｡⋆☂˚｡⋆｡˚☽˚｡⋆.

✨ (✿◡‿◡) ✨ I study 👩🏻‍💻 computer science and 🧪 chemistry at the University of British Columbia.
 I'm interested in systems programming, programming languages, chemical biology, drugs, compilers and computer science education.
 I think it's fun to lift weights and eat too much dark chocolate.
