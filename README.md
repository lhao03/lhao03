## ✨ Hi and Welcome, I'm Lucy!
👩‍💻 I am a second year computer science student minoring in 🧬 biochemistry @[ubc](https://ubc.ca) in the Faculty of Science. ✨ Currently I'm a developer at [ubc best](https://github.com/UBC-BEST) ⚕️ and I lead outreach at [StarHacks](https://www.starhacks.tech/) 💫. I am interested in the intersection of chemistry/biology, health care and computer science! In my free time I like (more like used to) to 🏋️‍♀️ powerlift and 🎶 listen to kpop. 💼 I am looking for internships from May-Aug 2021. Check out my [site](https://haolucy.tech/) to learn more and feel free to contact me!
