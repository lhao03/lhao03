### welcome!
👩‍🔬 I am a second year computer science student planning to pursue a combined major with a focus in microbiology and immunology at [UBC](https://ubc.ca) in the Faculty of Science! 

I like to lift weights 🏋️‍♀️ and eat [ice cream](https://www.madebymarcus.ca/) 🍦. I am also looking for internships in 2021 from Jan-Apr and May-Aug. Check out my [site](https://haolucy.tech/) to learn more!

### what i'm working on 👩‍💻
I'm currently working on a [flutter app](https://github.com/lhao03/nutrin-food-tracking-app) 📱, a secret project (that may or not may surface), and summer classes.
