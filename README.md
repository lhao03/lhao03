### welcome!
👩‍🔬 I am a second year computer science student planning to pursue a combined major with a focus in microbiology and immunology at [UBC](https://ubc.ca) in the Faculty of Science! As you can tell, I am interested in the conjunction between computer science and biological sciences. In my free time I like to lift weights 🏋️‍♀️ and eat [ice cream](https://www.madebymarcus.ca/) 🍦. 

### what i'm working on 👩‍💻
I'm currently working on a [flutter app](https://github.com/lhao03/nutrin-food-tracking-app) 📱, taking [bioinformatics courses](https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics), and deep learning courses!

I am looking for internships in 2021 from Jan-Apr and May-Aug. Check out my [site](https://haolucy.tech/) to learn more!
