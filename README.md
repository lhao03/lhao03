# ✨ welcome!
👩‍💻 I am a second year computer science student planning to minor in microbiology and immunology at [UBC](https://ubc.ca) in the Faculty of Science! I am interested in the conjunction between computer science and biological sciences. In my free time I like to powerlift 🏋️‍♀️ and eat [ice cream](https://www.madebymarcus.ca/) 🍦.

I am looking for internships in 2021 from Jan-Apr and May-Aug. Check out my [site](https://haolucy.tech/) to learn more and feel free to [contact me](mailto:hao.lucyy@gmail.com)!
