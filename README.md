## ✨ welcome! i'm lucy 
👩‍💻 I am a second year computer science student minoring in biochemistry @[UBC](https://ubc.ca) in the Faculty of Science. I am interested in the intersection of chemistry, health care and technology! In my free time I like to powerlift 🏋️‍♀️ and eat [ice cream](https://www.madebymarcus.ca/) 🍦. I am looking for internships from May-Aug 2021. Check out my [site](https://haolucy.tech/) to learn more and feel free to contact me!
